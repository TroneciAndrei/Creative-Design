# interview
This was my first interview for a Front-End Developer job

These were the requirements:

- Pay close attention to the details in the PSD
- The contents should be in a container with the design size. The background colors applied to the sections must be full width.
- The black navigation bar should be sticky to scroll
- The navigation home icon is active. Apply the same color to the hover on the buttons.
- The banner must be full width
- Sort by select must not have any functionality
- Project box at hover: the image has a zoom effect
- Got Questions: When an accordion opens, the previously opened accordion closes.
- Preferably without bootstrap frameworks but not required.
- Responsive:
a. Header contains only logo and mobile button
b. Navigation and header links will open at the click of a button on a black background.
